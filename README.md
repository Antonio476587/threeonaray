# Three on a ray 
In my country this game is called "La vieja" if there's no winner, then we say that "La vieja" has won. The winner can choose
if play with the [X] or the [O]. But in this example if you win you're going play with the "O" and if you loose will have the opportunity to play with the X.

This is a project of a little IA with pug view engine to play three on a ray. 

If you would like to play and test it. You'll have to clone the repo and then;

``` bash
# Install dependencies (only the first time)
npm install

# Run the local server at 3001
npm run start
```
